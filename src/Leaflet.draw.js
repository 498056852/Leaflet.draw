 * @class L.drawLocal
 * @aka L.drawLocal
 *
 * The core toolbar class of the API â€” it is used to create the toolbar ui
 *
 * ## Leaflet 1.0+ Examples
 *
 * - [Full Demo](./examples/full.html)
 * - [Popup](./examples/popup.html)
 * - [Snapping](./examples/snapping.html)
 * - [Edit Handlers](./examples/edithandlers.html)
 *
 * ## Leaflet 0.7+ Examples
 *
 * - [Full Demo](./examples/0.7.x/full.html)
 * - [Popup](./examples/0.7.x/popup.html)
 * - [Snapping](./examples/0.7.x/snapping.html)
 * - [Edit Handlers](./examples/0.7.x/edithandlers.html)
 *
 * @example
 * ```js
 *      var modifiedDraw = L.drawLocal.extend({
 *          draw: {
 *              toolbar: {
 *                  buttons: {
 *                      polygon: 'Draw an awesome polygon'
 *                  }
 *              }
 *          }
 *      });
 * ```
 *
 * The default state for the control is the draw toolbar just below the zoom control.
 *  This will allow map users to draw vectors and markers.
 *  **Please note the edit toolbar is not enabled by default.**
 *
 * To add the draw toolbar set the option drawControl: true in the map options.
 * ```js
 *      var map = L.map('map', {drawControl: true}).setView([51.505, -0.09], 13);
 *
 *      L.tileLayer('http://{s}.tile.osm.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
 *          attribution: '&copy; <a href="http://osm.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors'
 *      }).addTo(map);
 * ```
 *
 * ### Adding the edit toolbar
 * To use the edit toolbar you must initialise the Leaflet.draw control and manually add it to the map.
 *
 * ```js
 *      var map = L.map('map').setView([51.505, -0.09], 13);
 *
 *      L.tileLayer('http://{s}.tile.osm.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
 *          attribution: '&copy; <a href="http://osm.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors'
 *      }).addTo(map);
 *
 *      // FeatureGroup is to store editable layers
 *      var drawnItems = new L.FeatureGroup();
 *      map.addLayer(drawnItems);
 *
 *      var drawControl = new L.Control.Draw({
 *          edit: {
 *              featureGroup: drawnItems
 *          }
 *      });
 *      map.addControl(drawControl);
 * ```
 *
 * The key here is the featureGroup option. This tells the plugin which FeatureGroup contains the layers that
 * should be editable. The featureGroup can contain 0 or more features with geometry types Point, LineString, and Polygon.
 * Leaflet.draw does not work with multigeometry features such as MultiPoint, MultiLineString, MultiPolygon,
 * or GeometryCollection. If you need to add multigeometry features to the draw plugin, convert them to a
 * FeatureCollection of non-multigeometries (Points, LineStrings, or Polygons).
 *
 * ### Events
 * Once you have successfully added the Leaflet.draw plugin to your map you will want to respond to the different
 * actions users can initiate. The following events will be triggered on the map:
 *
 *
 * #### draw:created

 * | layerType | String | The type of layer this is. One of: `polyline`, `polygon`, `rectangle`, `circle`, `marker`
 *
 *
 * Triggered when a new vector or marker has been created.
 *
 * ```js
 * map.on('draw:created', function (e) {
 *    var type = e.layerType,
 *        layer = e.layer;
 *
 *    if (type === 'marker') {
 *        // Do marker specific actions
 *    }

 * map.on('draw:edited', function (e) {
 *    var layers = e.layers;
 *    layers.eachLayer(function (layer) {
 *        //do whatever you want, most likely save back to db
 *    });
 *});
 * ```
